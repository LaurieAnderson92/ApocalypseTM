        <h2>Conduct Rules</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Respect and Inclusivity</h3>
        <p>Treat all players, organizers, and staff with respect. Discrimination, harassment, or 
        bullying of any kind will not be tolerated based on factors such as race, ethnicity, 
        gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic.</p>

        <h3>Consent and Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Always obtain explicit consent before engaging in physical contact or role-playing 
        scenarios that may be sensitive or triggering for other participants. Respect 
        personal boundaries and be mindful of others' comfort levels.</p>

        <h3>Safety First</h3>
        <p>Prioritize safety in all aspects of gameplay. Follow any safety guidelines provided by organizers, 
        and report any hazards or concerns promptly. Do not engage in behavior that could jeopardize the physical 
        or emotional well-being of yourself or others.</p>

        <h3>Character Immersion</h3>
        <p>Stay in character during gameplay to maintain immersion for yourself and others. Avoid breaking 
        character unless necessary for safety reasons or to address out-of-game concerns.</p>

        <h3>No Cheating or Metagaming</h3>
        <p>Play fair and refrain from cheating, metagaming (using out-of-game knowledge for in-game advantage), 
        or exploiting loopholes in the rules. Respect the integrity of the game and the efforts of fellow 
        players.</p>

        <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
        <p>Handle conflicts or disagreements respectfully and constructively. If issues arise, attempt to resolve 
        them calmly and privately before involving organizers if necessary. Avoid escalating conflicts or 
        engaging in disruptive behavior.</p>

        <h3>Adherence to Rules and Lor</h3>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with and abide by the rules, guidelines, and lore established by the organizers. 
        Respect the setting, storyline, and fictional world created for the LARP, and avoid actions that 
        contradict established canon or disrupt the immersion of others.</p>

        <p>Remember that these rules are intended to foster a positive and inclusive environment for all 
        participants, enhancing the enjoyment and immersion of the LARP experience.</p>

        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Combat</h3>
        <p>Combat is resolved using a predetermined system, such as boffer weapons, rock-paper-scissors, or a dice-based mechanic.
            Players must abide by safety guidelines during combat, including proper weapon use and striking zones.
            Non-combat conflicts, such as negotiations or social interactions, may be resolved through role-playing, skill checks, or other mechanics. </p>

        <h3>Props, Costumes, and Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Players are encouraged to use props, costumes, and accessories to enhance the visual and immersive aspects of their characters.
            Organizers may provide props or set decorations to help establish the setting and atmosphere of the game world.
            Players should respect the game's aesthetic and refrain from using anachronistic or out-of-place items that could break immersion.</p>

        <h3>Resolving A Clash</h3>
        <p>A clash is a test of skills betwene two characters, it can take the form of a combat between the players, a game of rockpaper scisiors or
            any oher method or resolution that a Ref askes for, or two characters deciding on a method. A clash has four possible outcomes:
            <br>
            Victory: The character achieves their intended goal or gains an advantage in the conflict.
            <br>
            Defeat: The character fails to achieve their goal or suffers a setback in the conflict.
            <br>
            Draw: Neither character gains a clear advantage, and the conflict may continue or be resolved through alternative means.
            <br>
            Compromise: Characters may reach a mutually beneficial agreement or compromise, resolving the conflict without a clear winner or loser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The outcome of the Clash is integrated into the ongoing narrative of the LARP, shaping future events, character relationships, and story developments. 
            Organizers may use the results of Clashes to advance the plot, introduce new challenges, or create opportunities for character growth and development.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating a Character</h3>
        <p>A character starts with 6 skill points and can buy skills on character creation using this Website's character creator. Some Origins have skills that a 
            character must posess if they that Origin. The skills presented in this website are not an exaustive skill list of what is available to characters, 
            but rather what skills are only available at character creation. Further skills and enhancements can be bought between events with a Ref's approval.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Characters gain 2 skill points per event.</p>
