# ApocalypseTM

ApocalypseTM acts as a advert and a point of refrence for a upcoming UK based Live Action Roleplay with the same name, it contains the rules for how the game is goverened, the setting brief that the players need to know and funtionality to build a character for the game. As a new system designed by hobbiests, the rules and information may need to be updated regulaly. So utilizing Javascript a rule only needs to be updated in one location for it to be updated throughout the entire site.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

ApocalypseTM is a upcoming Live Action Role-Play based in the South West of England, Most of the space used is in Discord and Facebook which doesn't gell well with a interactive and tone setting experience. The Organizers of the game are spending a large amount of time manualy awnsering questions and repeating awnsers. This site aims to consense the relevant information and is designed to be easily updatable as the game continues.

#### Key information for the site

- The rules of the game, easily accessible on a mobile device while in play.
- A way to create a character without the need for mental maths
- Repositry of infoation about the game, setting and world.
- Synposis of coming games along with the location of the games that year.
- Links to the game social pages where new players can be interactive.

### User Stories

#### New LARPers
Users who haven't larped before, or have little experience Larping
- A first timer who is new to LARP should be able to find out what LARP is
- A first timer who is looking to attend their first LARP should find a clear list of what is expected of them
- Their experience of the website should be enhanced with intuitive navigation 

#### Players 
Users who have signed up to the game and are looking for rules or event information
- A player should be able to see, at a glance when the next event is and what the synopsis for the event is
- A player should be able to easily navigate the rules for how the game works
- Their experience should be thematic with a good user experience.

#### Game Masters 
Users who may use the website to help them run the game.
- A ref should be able to refer to rules quickly and have all of the information they need to make a ruling
- A ref should have easy access to the conduct rules incase players are in breach of them.
- Their experience should be focused on getting information that they need quickly, likely on a mobile screen.

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

![color palette](assets/documentation/colour-palette.png)

The website uses a pallate of colours that invoke a fantasy map, inspired by Lord of the Rings and other grand landscapes that also mirrors areas of outstanding beauty found in the south west of England

### Typography

Google fonts were used for this project:

Forum was used for the paragraph elements. It is a serif font.
Cinzel was used for headings. It is a serif font

Both fonts were used to invoke a fantasy feel to the page

### Imagery

The main imagry in this site is going to be London after a extintion event. The devestation levels are low, but nature will be reclaiming the world. the site will follow these warm dirt colors with effects to make images look weathered.
The pictures were open sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) or generated by [DeepAI](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img)

Edits to the images were made using [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/express/)

## Features

The website is comprised of seven pages, five of which are accessible from the navigation menu (index, rules, faq, character & world.) The other pages are a confirmatiopn page which is shown once a user submits the form on the character page and a 404 page.

### General features on each page

All of the website pages have:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate around the website. above the bar is a banner image that scales based on with and can expand into 4 images that depict the scene and tone of the game. The dropdown bar is behind the burger icon and is animated to be interactable and the rules button is front and center for easy reference, particularly on mobile devices.

- A footer that conatins the copywright information along with the socials of the webpage.

- Responsive controls that prevents the content from getting too wide on large and high resolution monitors above 1440px width.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Colour Scheme


### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

- git
- Github
- Balsamiq
- Googlemaps API

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

The content was provided by myself and a friend called Richard Morgan, who is one of the top refs for ApocaplyseTM

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.

###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
