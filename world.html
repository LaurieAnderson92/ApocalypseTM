            <h2>World</h2>
            <h3>The Lost World</h3>
            <p>It is known that the world was not always this way, elders and mad preachers spoke of days of warm sunny afternoons, 
            babbling brooks flowing freely with water not from a storage tank, with talk of strange creatures like the mythical 
            badger or horse, and a land where one could walk freely outside of the walls freely and without fear of attack or worse.
            </p>
            <p>Stories born of madness and childish fantasy. Humanity has resided behind the walls for hundreds of generations. The outside
            world is dangerous, unforgiving and brutal, a harsh hostile environment that nothing of value or worth can survive.</p>
            <h3>A Harsh Reality</h3>
            <p>The reality outside the walls is one of harshness and hostility. The once vibrant landscapes have been ravaged by time 
            and neglect, leaving behind a desolate wilderness where survival is a daily struggle. Savage beasts roam freely, 
            and the very air seems to carry a sense of menace.</p>
            <h3>The Walls</h3>
            <p>For generations, the people have relied on the safety provided by their towering walls. These fortifications 
            are not just physical barriers but also symbols of humanity's resilience in the face of adversity. Within their 
            confines, society has thrived, adapting to the challenges of their enclosed existence.</p>
            <h3>The Dwellers</h3>
            <p>The most defended settlements are built on remenents of the old world, and it is within these fortifcations that the 
            dwellers live. Dweller settlments are kept togther through order and unity. Their inhabiatnts wear uniforms, armour and 
            insignia unaware of their old world meaning</p>
            <h3>The Wastlanders</h3>
            <p>When no walls were to be found, the wastlanders made them using old world relics and reclaimed metals. Wastelander 
            settlements are built on inginuity and guile. Their inhabiatnets wear clothes made from after the calamity, leathers and 
            cloth with aparatus needed to travel through the more inhospitable lands.</p>
            <h3>The Twisted</h3>
            <p>There are few Twisted groups that interact with other factions outside of crossed blades and banditry. Their best defence is their 
            mobility, moving from location to location, Communities of twisted are held together through sheer fanatical idolotry to the 
            old world icons. They adorn their attire with objects of their devotion, such as facepaint to resemble the clown prince of the 
            golden arches or the numbers shirts of the warriors of the foot.</p>
            <h3>The Altered & The Enchanced</h3>
            <p>In rare instances. you amy find somone enhanced by the old world, or a survior that has been forever altered by the calamity.
            these people have been permantly changed by either the strange radient magicsa left over from the collapse, or the advanced technology 
            that predates it. The Altered are mutated creatures of flesh, while the enhanced are old relages, a fusion between person and relic machinary
