            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>Do I need experience to play?</h3>
            <p>
            Not at all! LARPing is for everyone, regardless of experience level. All of our events cater to beginners and provide guidance on character creation, rules, and gameplay.
            </p>
            <h3>How much does an event cost?</h3>
            <p>
            Events cost £30 per person, with an aditional £10 if you wish to arrive on the thrusday night and set up early. This fee is payable once your character has been created and you have booked in our events.

            Children under 14 can attend for free, as long as there is one parent or guardian per 2 children attending, Players between 14-18, who are retired or are in posession of a Student card or receipt of universal Credit can attend an event for £15, 
            or £25 if they are staying on the Thursday night
            </p>
            <h3>Are there age restrictions for LARPing?</h3>
            <p>
            Not at all. When roleplaying, you should aim to treat children as children as far as is humanly possible. However this is within the context of a society that expects children to have as much autonomy and responsibility as they can sensibly handle. 
            Sociaty's viewpoint is that th is defended by its heroes and that children are the heroes of tomorrow. As such they are encouraged to take an interest in the business of state and the way it runs, to learn how to fight and defend themselves. 
            You determine how your character regards children, but your character is part of a society that tries to include children, not one that believes children should be “seen and not heard”.

            Despite its mature themes of war, devestation and monsters in the dark, ApocalpseTM is as much of a fairy tale as it is a mature game. If your child can enjoy Lord of the Rings then they can enjoy the content that is provided here.
